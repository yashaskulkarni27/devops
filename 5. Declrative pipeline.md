Sure, here's a detailed README.md on how to set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins for a project with HTML files hosted on GitHub and deploying them to a Xampp server.

# Setting Up CI/CD with Jenkins for HTML Deployment on Xampp

This guide will walk you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins to automatically deploy HTML files hosted on a GitHub repository to a Xampp server.

## Prerequisites

1. **Jenkins**: Make sure you have Jenkins installed and running. You can download Jenkins from [here](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **GitHub Repository**: Have a GitHub repository set up with your HTML files. Ensure that Jenkins can access this repository.

3. **Xampp Server**: Set up a Xampp server where you want to deploy your HTML files. Ensure that Jenkins can access this server.

## Jenkins Plugins

Make sure the following Jenkins plugins are installed:

- GitHub Plugin: For integrating Jenkins with GitHub.
- Pipeline Plugin: For creating Jenkins pipeline jobs.
- SSH Plugin: For deploying files to the Xampp server via SSH.

## Configuring Jenkins

1. **Set up GitHub Credentials**: In Jenkins, navigate to `Credentials` > `System` > `Global credentials (unrestricted)` and add your GitHub credentials.

2. **Set up SSH Credentials**: Add SSH credentials for your Xampp server. Navigate to `Credentials` > `System` > `Global credentials (unrestricted)` and add your SSH private key.

3. **Create a New Pipeline Job**: 
   - Click on `New Item` on the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Enter a name for your job (e.g., `HTML_Deploy`).
   - Select `Pipeline` and click `OK`.
   
4. **Configure Pipeline Script**: In the job configuration page:
   - Select `Pipeline script` from the `Definition` dropdown.
   - Write a Jenkinsfile (declarative pipeline) to define your CI/CD process.

## Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout code from GitHub
                git 'https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy to Xampp') {
            steps {
                // Copy HTML files to Xampp server via SSH
                sshagent(credentials: ['your-ssh-credentials-id']) {
                    sh '''
                        scp -r ./ your-xampp-username@your-xampp-server:/path/to/xampp/htdocs
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `yourusername`, `your-repo`, `your-ssh-credentials-id`, `your-xampp-username`, and `your-xampp-server` with your actual GitHub username, repository name, SSH credentials ID, Xampp username, and server address respectively.

## Running the Pipeline

- Click on `Build Now` in your Jenkins job dashboard to trigger the pipeline.
- Jenkins will clone your GitHub repository, and if successful, it will deploy the HTML files to your Xampp server.

Now, your HTML files will be automatically deployed to your Xampp server whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.
