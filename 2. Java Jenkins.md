Let's simplify the steps and provide a bit more detail for someone new to Jenkins and Java development:

## Prerequisites:
1. **Jenkins**: Make sure Jenkins is installed and running on your system. You can download and install it from the official website.
2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install JDK on your system. You can download it from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

## Steps:

### 1. Create a Java program:
Create a simple Java program that adds two numbers together. Here's an example:

```java
public class AddTwoNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 5;
        int num2 = 10;
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

Save this code in a file named `AddTwoNumbers.java`.

### 2. Set up a Git repository:
If you're not familiar with Git, it's a version control system. Create a Git repository to store your Java code. You can use GitHub, GitLab, or any other Git hosting service. Initialize the repository, add the `AddTwoNumbers.java` file, and commit your changes.

### 3. Create a Jenkins pipeline:
- Open Jenkins in your web browser.
- Click on "New Item" to create a new pipeline job.
- Name your job and select "Pipeline", then click "OK".
- Scroll down to the "Pipeline" section and choose "Pipeline script from SCM".
- Select Git as your SCM and provide the repository URL.
- Save your job configuration.

### 4. Write Jenkinsfile:
In your repository, create a file named `Jenkinsfile` (without any file extension) with the following content:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'javac AddTwoNumbers.java'
            }
        }
        stage('Run') {
            steps {
                sh 'java AddTwoNumbers'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Save and commit:
Save the Jenkinsfile in your repository and commit the changes.

### 6. Run the pipeline:
- Go back to Jenkins and find your pipeline job.
- Click on "Build Now" to trigger the pipeline manually.
- Jenkins will automatically fetch your code, compile the Java program, and run it.
- You should see the sum of the two numbers printed in the Jenkins console output.

### 7. Verify the output:
Check the Jenkins console output for the sum of the two numbers.

That's it! You've successfully set up a Jenkins pipeline to build and execute a Java program for adding two numbers.
