Certainly! Below are the steps to set up Continuous Integration (CI) process in Jenkins to build a Java program (addition of two numbers) every 2 minutes from a GitHub repository. Let's create a `README.md` file to document these steps:

# Continuous Integration with Jenkins

This guide will walk you through setting up Continuous Integration (CI) using Jenkins to build a Java program for adding two numbers from a GitHub repository every 2 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and running
- GitHub account
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

## Steps

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new GitHub repository to host your Java program. You can name it `java-addition`.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-addition.git
```

### 3. Create a Java Program

Create a Java program named `Addition.java` in the repository with the following content:

```java
public class Addition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 5;
        int num2 = 10;
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

### 4. Push Changes to GitHub

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Addition.java"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Set Up Jenkins

- Open Jenkins in your web browser.
- Navigate to the dashboard and click on "New Item".
- Enter a name for your Jenkins job (e.g., `java-addition-ci`) and select "Freestyle project", then click "OK".

### 6. Configure Jenkins Job

- Under the "General" tab, check the option "GitHub project" and enter your repository URL.
- Under the "Build Triggers" tab, check the option "Build periodically" and enter `H/2 * * * *` in the schedule text box. This will run the job every 2 minutes.
- Under the "Build" tab, add a build step to compile and run your Java program. You can use the following shell commands:

```bash
javac Addition.java
java Addition
```

### 7. Save and Run

Save your Jenkins job configuration and click on "Build Now" to run the job manually for the first time.

### 8. Monitor Builds

You can monitor the build status and output logs in Jenkins. Subsequent builds will automatically trigger every 2 minutes according to the schedule.

These steps should guide you through setting up a continuous integration process in Jenkins to build a Java program for adding two numbers every 2 minutes from your GitHub repository.
